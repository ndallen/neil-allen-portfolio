\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Linters
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
I use VS Studio Code on Mac so for HTML I used  HTMLHint and for CSS I used the built in CSS linter which worked great. The other ones I downloaded didn\'92t seem to do anything different so if it isn\'92t broke..\
\
I changed anything that needed doing before pushing through into the HTML validator stage.\

\f0\b \ul HTML Validation Testing
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
\
I had a lot of issues here which I worked through until they were were completed.\
\
Issues such as;\
\
- Having role=\'93link\'94 in my a links on footer icons kicked up a warning, removed these so all fine.\
\
- The copyright @ Neil Allen 2019 was not inside a li, it was initially inside a span and caused an issue. Sorted.\
\
- With the SVG animation had some syntax issues from the copy and paste eg a ? Character in tag for some reason. Removed and still worked so happy days.\
\
- I was using old HTML code for table width, alignment, padding, spacing etc. This was moved across to CSS and sorted.\
\
I thought this tool was excellent. Would have been handy at the start but its a good exercise to go through your code and sort issues.\
